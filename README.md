# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìå Introduction
This repository focuses on **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It covers the process of identifying, documenting, and analyzing software requirements. The goal is to ensure that the system meets stakeholder expectations, reduces errors, and provides a clear blueprint for development.

---

## üß† What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the SDLC where stakeholders' needs are collected, clarified, and documented to guide software development. This phase involves:

- Gathering requirements from stakeholders  
- Translating business needs into structured software specifications  
- Identifying conflicts or ambiguities early  
- Creating a foundation for design, development, and testing  

Proper requirement analysis ensures that the final software product meets user expectations and reduces costly errors during development.

## ‚≠ê Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is essential because:

1. **Prevents Scope Creep**  
   Defines project boundaries clearly to avoid unplanned changes that increase cost and time.

2. **Reduces Development Errors**  
   Ensures that features are built correctly the first time, minimizing rework.

3. **Enhances Stakeholder Satisfaction**  
   Ensures the final product aligns with business goals and user expectations.

## üîç Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The main activities include:

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting information from stakeholders via interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Refining requirements using brainstorming, prototyping, and observation.  
- **Requirement Documentation**: Writing clear, structured documents such as SRS, use cases, and diagrams.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Classifying, prioritizing, and visualizing requirements.  
- **Requirement Validation**: Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and feasibility.

## ‚öô Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define **what the system should do**. Examples include:

- User registration and login  
- Property listing management  
- Search and filter properties  
- Booking creation and cancellation  
- Payment processing  
- Admin management of users, listings, and bookings  

---

## üõ° Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define **how the system performs**. Examples include:

- **Performance**: Page load ‚â§ 2 seconds  
- **Security**: Encrypted user and payment data  
- **Scalability**: Support increasing users and listings  
- **Availability**: 24/7 uptime ‚â• 99%  
- **Usability**: Intuitive and accessible interface  

---

## üë• System Actors
- **Guest**: Browse properties and create an account  
- **Registered User**: Book and manage reservations  
- **Property Owner**: List and manage properties  
- **Administrator**: Supervise the system, manage users and listings  

---

## üé¨ Use Cases
Key use cases include:

1. **Search Property**: Users search and filter available properties.  
2. **Book Property**: Users reserve properties and complete payment.  
3. **Manage Listings**: Property owners add, update, or remove property listings.  
4. **User Management**: Admin manages users, bookings, and listings.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
Each feature must meet specific conditions to be considered complete:

- Booking is successful only if payment is confirmed  
- Property is marked unavailable after confirmed booking  
- Users can update their profile without affecting bookings  
- Admin can generate reports and manage system data

## üßæ Conclusion
This README.md serves as a complete **requirement analysis blueprint** for a Property Booking System. It covers all aspects of requirement gathering, documentation, functional & non-functional requirements, actors, use cases, and acceptance criteria to provide a solid foundation for development.
